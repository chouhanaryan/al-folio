I am a senior at [Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering](http://djsce.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, studying Computer Engineering. I am passionate about developing software, tinkering with the web and working with data.

I am also a **Teaching Assistant** at [Unicode's Machine Learning Summer Course](http://djunicode.github.io/umlsc-2021/){:target="\_blank"}.

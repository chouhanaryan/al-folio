I am a senior at [Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering](http://djsce.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, studying Computer Engineering. I am passionate about developing software, tinkering with the web and working with data.

I am currently working as a **Research Intern** at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/en-us/). I am also a **Teaching Assistant** at [Unicode's Machine Learning Summer Course](http://djunicode.github.io/umlsc-2021/){:target="\_blank"}.  I was previously a **Data Analyst Intern** at [Tech Mahindra](http://techmahindra.com/){:target="\_blank"}, one of India's top IT firms and a **Software Engineering Intern** at [Apli.ai](http://apli.ai/){:target="\_blank}.

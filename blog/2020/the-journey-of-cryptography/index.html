<p>You wouldnâ€™t know it by looking at it, but I just spoiled the Star Wars plot for you.</p>

<p>How did I do this? And why is it so important?</p>

<p>Modern cryptography is the backbone of the digital age. We hardly ever see it except when we unassumingly enter our passwords while logging in to our favorite websites, but it is the strongest defense we have against unwarranted attacks on our privacy.</p>

<p>The notion of encryption was a direct consequence of the fracturing of human society into partisan factions and the emergence of a general sense of distrust. Necessity is the mother of invention and this fathered the field of encryption.</p>

<p>Even though the first known use of cryptography can be traced back to 1900 BC Egypt, the concept was hardly restricted by time or geography. The Greeks, the Romans, the Mesopotamians and the Indians â€“ all major civilizations â€“ knew about and adopted encryption in their cultural practices.</p>

<p>However, much of this was limited to simplistic calculations and physical devices, and was hence termed â€˜classical cryptographyâ€™.</p>

<p>Modern cryptology originated from the Arabs around 717 AD, as they systematically documented cryptology and cryptanalysis methods. Several advances were made during this period, the most significant of all by a mathematician and philosopher named Al-Kindi who invented the frequency analysis technique to break ciphers.</p>

<p>Progress after that period was spotty if anything and advanced techniques wouldnâ€™t emerge for more than a thousand years till the First World War began.</p>

<p>From this point onwards, unfortunately, the history of cryptography is laced with the blood of wars with each subsequent war spurring the need for more secure methods of encryption. In fact, it was the successful interception and decoding of the Zimmerman Telegram by British Intelligence that directly led to the United States entering the First World War. The calculated use of encryption methods would later be a major cause of the Alliesâ€™ victory as well.</p>

<p>Secure communication only became more important in the Second World War with the emergence of the German â€˜Enigmaâ€™ and the Japanese â€˜Purpleâ€™ machines that proved to be virtually unbreakable. The legendary mathematician and â€˜father of modern computingâ€™, Alan Turing was successful in decrypting the Enigma (which some say was significant in shortening the length of the war), while the US Navy cracked Purple and most other subsequent techniques. Unbeknownst to most, more than 18,000 women were also involved in the US and UK code-breaking operations.</p>

<p>The birth of scientific and modern cryptography is attributed to Claude E Shannon, the â€˜father of information theoryâ€™ who developed a mathematical theory of cryptography towards the end of the Second World War. In the 1970s, emerged the Data Encryption Standard cipher for public use, which was later decommissioned and made way for the Advanced Encryption Standard which is now used worldwide.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1976 however, that the single most significant advancement in cryptosystems was made with the birth of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, one of the first public-key protocols. This was followed shortly afterward by Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman (RSA) which is now one of the most widely used cryptosystems in the world.</p>

<p>What is bewildering is the fact that even though there are no published methods to crack the algorithm, there is considerable speculation that future mathematical advances might render it and other such methods useless. With the advent of quantum computers and higher and cheaper computing prowess, the need to develop and standardize encryption methods that are â€˜quantum-proofâ€™ is increasing by the day.</p>

<p>As we step into an uncharted future with the agonizing responsibility of skepticism thrust upon us, it is my sincere hope that we can build a society that looks beyond reflexive misgivings and fosters the growth of the human spirit.</p>

<p>Just like Luke Skywalker does, after defeating his father, Darth Vader.</p>

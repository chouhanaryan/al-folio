  <hr>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>There are very few comparisons that stand the test of time and reason when it comes to drawing a parallel with the pursuit of the biblical Holy Grail. The closest our generation has come to a quest of similar magnitude has been the hunt for Artificial General Intelligence. Almost Hollywood-esque, the tale is ripe with myths and mysteries.</p>

<p>Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI for short, is the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that can understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being ordinarily can. It represents more than just a leap in some obscure sub-field of computer science and mathematics simply because of the immediate impact that the use of this technology will have on human society.</p>

<p>Despite our best attempts at predicting post-AGI civilization, the truth is that we cannot begin to comprehend the stakes that are at play. The most modest estimations start with notions of dramatic transformations in day-to-day life and go up to outlining dystopian AI rebellions.</p>

<p>How far away from the cliff are we then, if one even exists? Probably very far away, right?</p>

<p>But - <em>what if weâ€™re not</em>?</p>

<p>That is the question that Elon Musk presented to Pieter Abbeel, a professor at UC Berkeley who eventually became an integral part of the OpenAI team.</p>

<p>Today, OpenAI is one of the leading AI research labs in the world. Founded in 2015 by industry heavyweights such as Elon Musk (who has since resigned from the board), Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, Ilya Sutskever, and others, it had the additional backing of companies such as Microsoft and Infosys.</p>

<p>OpenAI describes its aim as the promotion and development of democratized and friendly AI, in such a way as to benefit humanity as a whole. However, despite its humble non-profit origins, it has since transitioned into a for-profit company.</p>

<p>OpenAIâ€™s approach to solving AGI has, in a broad sense, been that of diversification. By achieving a significant understanding of the world using Reinforcement Learning on different mediums such as text, images, sound and other data â€“ and then putting all of these models together â€“ the company believes it can achieve AGI. As time progresses, these bets will rise, fall, cross-pollinate and hopefully â€“ converge.</p>

<p>In its short 4-year lifetime, the companyâ€™s cutting-edge applications have defined innovation in the AI industry, despite drawing criticism for seeking unwarranted publicity. OpenAI Gym (environment for AGI benchmarking), OpenAI Five (Dota 2 bots) and GPT-2 (generative language model), to name a few, have been pioneering products in their respective fields.</p>

<p>OpenAI is hardly alone in this pursuit, however. Given the glamour of the prize, it is only reasonable to expect cutthroat competition. Right on top, stands the most eligible (and well-funded) suitor of all â€“ Googleâ€™s DeepMind.</p>

<p>What originated as a three-man start-up in University College Londonâ€™s Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, is currently an undisputed industry leader. Their story began with teaching AI how to play old, primitive games from the 70s and 80s, such as Breakout and Space Invaders and today, they fearlessly aim to â€˜solve intelligenceâ€™. The company was curiously also funded by Elon Musk and Peter Theil in its nascent stages but was later acquired by Google in 2014.</p>

<p>They made headlines in 2016 after their AlphaGo program beat the world Go champion, Lee Sedol, in a five-game match (later the subject of a fantastic documentary film). The company went on to improve on their success â€“ building AlphaGo Zero (which beat AlphaGo 100 to 0) and AlphaZero (which was built entirely using self-play and can play Go, Chess and Shogi). Last year, the company announced AlphaStar, a program to play the real-time strategy game StarCraft II, the results of which were astounding.</p>

<p>Their overall approach focuses on the combination of Reinforcement Learning, Unsupervised Learning and other machine learning algorithms with Systems Neuroscience to produce general-purpose learning algorithms.</p>

<p>DeepMind has also risen above its competitors with a sincere focus on scientific and health issues. It rolled out AlphaFold, a program to solve the very critical â€“ and the very difficult â€“ problem of protein folding. Despite its several other ventures relating to health, it has had its fair share of controversies. In 2016 it was smack dab in the middle of an NHS data-sharing scandal.</p>

<p>Both companies, along with a legion of other small organizations and individuals continue to power the search for AGI. The field is bubbling with advancements with most research being released as open-source software.</p>

<p>Who knows how far away we are from the one, true AGI.</p>

<p>At least in the meantime, you can be content that this article wasnâ€™t written by a machine.</p>

<p>â€¦ or was it?</p>
